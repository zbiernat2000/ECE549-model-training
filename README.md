# ECE549-model-training
Code for the Advanced robots final project. The project controlled a roomba through hand gestures detected using a resnet50. 
The talker.py file should be used with the ROS master computer, and requires a webcam. The robot.cpp file should be used with the slave computer, and requires the computer to be connected to the roomba.
